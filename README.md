# Homework - OO C++

Homework for OO C++ module.

# Problem 1

Recall the OO Python homework in which you created a Vector class.
Do the same in C++.  Although C++ unit-test tools exist, you can
implement your own by creating functions that return 1 or 0.

Organize your code in any way you wish, but make sure to include 
a `Makefile` so that I can easily compile your test program.
